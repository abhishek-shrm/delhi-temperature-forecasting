# delhi-temperature-forecasting

It is a forecasting problem where I have to forecast the temperature of Delhi at a specific date.

**Use the following commands to run the application :**

`sudo docker build -t delhi-temperature-prediction:1.0.0 .`

`sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 delhi-temperature-prediction:1.0.0`
